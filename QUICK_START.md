# Quick Start Guide - Revenue Leakage Detection System

## Welcome!

This guide will help you get the Revenue Leakage Detection System up and running in just a few minutes.

## What This System Does

This system automatically finds money your company is losing due to billing errors. It's like having an AI detective that checks your billing system 24/7 to find missing charges, wrong prices, and other revenue leaks.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Check Your Requirements
Make sure you have:
- Python 3.8 or newer installed
- Internet connection for downloading packages

### 2. Install the System
Open your terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
# Download the system (if you haven't already)
git clone <repository-url>
cd revenue-leakage-detector

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create Test Data
To see how it works, create sample data:

```bash
python scripts/generate_sample_data.py
```

This creates fake billing data with intentional errors for testing.

### 4. Run the Analysis
Run the complete revenue leakage detection:

```bash
python main.py
```

You'll see output showing:
- How many billing errors were found
- How much money is potentially lost
- What actions should be taken

### 5. View Results in Your Browser
Start the web dashboard:

```bash
python web/app.py
```

Then open your browser to:
- http://localhost:8000

You'll see:
- Dashboard with key metrics
- Charts showing leakage patterns
- List of issues that need attention
- Investigation tickets to assign to your team
