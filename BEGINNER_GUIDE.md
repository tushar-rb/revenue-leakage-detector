## Introduction

Welcome to the Revenue Leakage Detection System! This is an advanced AI-powered application that automatically identifies lost revenue in billing systems. Whether you're a business analyst, developer, or IT professional, this guide will help you understand how the system works and how to use it effectively.

## What is Revenue Leakage?

Revenue leakage refers to money that a company should be receiving but isn't, due to various issues in the billing process. Common examples include:

- Services that were provided but never billed
- Incorrect pricing or rates applied to customer accounts
- Usage that was recorded but not properly translated into charges
- Duplicate entries in billing systems
- Expired promotional rates that weren't updated
- Contract terms that weren't properly implemented

This system helps identify these issues automatically, saving companies significant money that would otherwise be lost.

## System Overview

The Revenue Leakage Detection System uses a unique multi-agent AI architecture with three specialized agents:

1. **Data Analyst Agent (MUSCLE)** - Handles data processing and joining
2. **Audit Analyst Agent (MUSCLE + BRAIN)** - Detects revenue leakage using mathematical analysis and AI context understanding
3. **Reporting Agent (BRAIN)** - Creates intelligent reports and investigation tickets

The system processes billing data, usage logs, provisioning records, and contract information to identify potential revenue leakage.

## How the System Works

The system operates in a three-stage pipeline:

### Stage 1: Data Processing (Data Analyst Agent)
- Loads multiple data sources (customers, contracts, billing, usage, provisioning)
- Cleans and normalizes the data
- Joins data from different sources to create a unified view
- Engineers features for leakage detection
- Prepares data for analysis

### Stage 2: Leakage Detection (Audit Analyst Agent)
- Performs mathematical analysis to identify discrepancies
- Uses machine learning to detect statistical anomalies
- Applies business rules and context understanding
- Calculates financial impact of each finding
- Assigns confidence scores to detections

### Stage 3: Reporting (Reporting Agent)
- Creates investigation tickets for each detection
- Generates executive summaries with business insights
- Prioritizes findings based on financial impact and urgency
- Recommends actions to resolve issues
- Creates detailed reports for different audiences

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip package manager

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd revenue-leakage-detector
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Generate sample data** (for testing purposes):
   ```bash
   python scripts/generate_sample_data.py
   ```

This creates sample data files in the `data/sample/` directory that simulate a real billing system with intentional errors.

## Running the System

### Command Line Usage

To run the complete analysis pipeline:
```bash
python main.py
```

You can also customize the run with options:
```bash
python main.py --confidence-threshold 0.8 --log-level DEBUG
```

### Web Interface

To run the web dashboard:
```bash
python web/app.py
```

Then open your browser to:
- http://localhost:8000 (Standard dashboard)
- http://localhost:8000/enhanced (Enhanced dashboard with Indian formatting)

## Key Components

### 1. Data Analyst Agent (agents/data_analyst.py)
- **Role**: Data processing and preparation
- **Key Functions**:
  - Loads and joins multiple data sources
  - Cleans and normalizes data
  - Creates derived features for analysis
  - Optimizes data for downstream processing

### 2. Audit Analyst Agent (agents/audit_analyst.py)
- **Role**: Revenue leakage detection
- **Key Functions**:
  - Identifies missing charges
  - Detects incorrect rates
  - Finds usage mismatches
  - Identifies duplicate entries
  - Uses machine learning for anomaly detection
  - Calculates financial impact

### 3. Reporting Agent (agents/reporting_agent.py)
- **Role**: Intelligent reporting and ticket generation
- **Key Functions**:
  - Creates investigation tickets
  - Generates executive summaries
  - Prioritizes findings
  - Recommends actions
  - Creates detailed analysis reports

### 4. Web Application (web/app.py)
- **Role**: User interface and API
- **Key Functions**:
  - Real-time dashboard monitoring
  - Interactive reports and visualizations
  - Investigation ticket management
  - System status monitoring

## Understanding the Results

After running the system, you'll find several types of output:

### Detection Results
Stored in `data/processed/audit_detections.csv`:
- Detection ID
- Customer information
- Type of leakage detected
- Severity level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- Estimated financial impact
- Confidence score
- Detailed description

### Investigation Tickets
Stored in `data/reports/investigation_tickets.csv`:
- Ticket ID
- Title and description
- Priority level
- Recommended investigation steps
- Business impact assessment
- Assigned team

### Reports
Stored in `data/reports/`:
- Executive summary reports (JSON format)
- Detailed analysis reports (Markdown format)

## Web Dashboard

The web interface provides real-time monitoring and visualization:

1. **Dashboard** - Shows key metrics like total detections, estimated loss, and critical issues
2. **Reports** - Displays executive summaries and detailed analysis
3. **Tickets** - Lists all investigation tickets with filtering and sorting capabilities
4. **Analytics** - Shows trends and patterns in revenue leakage

### Key Dashboard Features
- Real-time metrics monitoring
- Interactive charts and graphs
- One-click analysis execution
- Sample data generation
- Ticket management interface

## Extending the System

### Adding New Detection Types

To add a new type of revenue leakage detection:

1. Modify the Audit Analyst Agent in `agents/audit_analyst.py`
2. Add a new detection method following the existing patterns
3. Update the reporting templates in `agents/reporting_agent.py` to handle the new type

### Customizing Business Rules

The system uses configurable business rules stored in:
- `agents/audit_analyst.py` (detection thresholds)
- `agents/reporting_agent.py` (priority rules, team assignments)

You can modify these to match your organization's specific requirements.

### Adding New Data Sources

To add new data sources:
1. Update the data loading functions in `agents/data_analyst.py`
2. Modify the data joining logic to incorporate the new source
3. Update the sample data generator in `scripts/generate_sample_data.py`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Solution: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **No Data Found**
   - Solution: Run `python scripts/generate_sample_data.py` to create test data

3. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Solution: Ensure the database file exists or check configuration in `.env`

4. **Web Interface Not Loading**
   - Solution: Check that `python web/app.py` is running and no port conflicts exist

### Debugging Tips

- Use `--log-level DEBUG` when running the main script for detailed logs
- Check the `logs/` directory for error logs
- Verify that all required data files exist in `data/sample/`

### Performance Issues

- For large datasets, consider increasing the `--batch-size` parameter
- Use `--log-file` to save logs to a file for analysis
- Check system resources if processing is slow

## Next Steps

1. **Try it with your data**: Replace the sample data with your actual billing data
2. **Customize detection rules**: Adjust thresholds and business rules to match your needs
3. **Integrate with your systems**: Use the API to connect with your existing tools
4. **Schedule regular runs**: Set up automated analysis using cron or similar tools
